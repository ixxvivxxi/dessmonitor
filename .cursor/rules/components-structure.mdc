# Component Structure

**Where to put components:**

- **`components/ui/`** — Reusable UI primitives (Card, CardHeader, CardRow, buttons, etc.). Shared building blocks.
- **`components/<feature>/`** — Feature-specific components grouped by domain (e.g. `dashboard/`, `setup/`). Keep related components together.
- **`components/` root** — App shell, layout, and top-level screens (app-layout, top-bar, container, setup-screen, language-chooser).

**Rules:**
- New feature-specific components → add to `components/<feature>/` or create a new feature folder.
- New reusable primitives → add to `components/ui/`.
- Colocate: place components in the deepest folder that makes sense; avoid flat component roots.
- Imports: `../ui/card` from feature folders; `../../hooks/...` when crossing feature boundaries.
